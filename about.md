# About Me

I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Statistics and Operations Research Department at UNC Chapel Hill, under the advisement of Dr. Zhengwu Zhang, Dr. Jan Hannig and Dr. Steve Marron.  I focus primarily on applied statistics for network data and curriculum development for moral machine learning.  Prior to coming to UNC, I obtained my undergraduate degree in mathematical sciences from Clemson University in 2020.  I am also a graduate fellow of the UNC Parr Center for Ethics, and the coach of the 2023-2024 UNC intercollegiate ethics bowl team.  

Outside of teaching and research, I am an outdoor enthusiast and a voracious reader of classic fiction. I spend a majority of my spare time either in the mountains with my fiancee and dog or in one of the worlds that Charles Dickens brought to life.  Accordingly, I find that a hard pitch of rock-climbing or several chapters of *Great Expectations* mends most stressful days.  Finally, if nothing else works, you can find me tinkering on my 1978 f100 Ranger.
