# About Me 

Outside of teaching and research, I am an outdoor enthusiast, amateur ethicist, and classics (from trucks to novels) afficionado.  The majority of my spare time is spent roaming the mountains, whether that be by climbing, running, or backpacking.  Below you can find me pulling hard on the crux of *Devil in the White House*, a classic route at Pilot Mountain State Park, and summitting Mount Ida along the continental divide in Rocky Mountain National Park.
