I am primarily interested in data integration for high dimensional, network data.  This can include both methodological work, such as 1), and application-driven work.  My ongoing work is of this latter form, and involves applying 1) to Human Connectome Project data.  I anticipate this work being submitted in this calendar year, but it has also inspired some exciting future methodological work on Jackstraw for DIVAS.
