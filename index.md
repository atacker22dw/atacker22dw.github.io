# Welcome
I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Lafayette College.  I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics and Operations Research at UNC Chapel Hill, under the advisement of Dr. Zhengwu Zhang, Dr. Jan Hannig and Dr. Steve Marron.  I focus primarily on high dimensional inference and data integration, algorithmic bias, and interpretable machine learning.  Prior to coming to UNC, I obtained my undergraduate degree in mathematical sciences from Clemson University in 2020.  I am also deeply involved with high school and intercollegiate ethics bowl and was the coach of the 2023-2024 UNC intercollegiate ethics bowl team.
