## Curriculum Developed 
1. **STOR 390: Machine Learning -- Ethics and Society**
   - This course satisfied the *data, culture, and society* credit of the UNC Data Science Minor, and elective credit for the Statistics and Analytics Minor.
   - STOR 323 is the new (permanent) course listing at UNC.  It is being taught by a variety of faculty and now satisfies elective credit in the STAN major as well.  
   - A pedagogical paper has been produced pertaining to this course and is discussed on the [Research](research.md) page.
