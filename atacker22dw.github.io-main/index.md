# Welcome
I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the Statistics and Operations Research Department at UNC Chapel Hill, under the advisement of Dr. Zhengwu Zhang, Dr. Jan Hannig and Dr. Steve Marron.  I focus primarily on high dimensional data integration and interpretable machine learning.  Prior to coming to UNC, I obtained my undergraduate degree in mathematical sciences from Clemson University in 2020.  I am also a graduate fellow of the UNC Parr Center for Ethics, and the coach of the 2023-2024 UNC intercollegiate ethics bowl team.
